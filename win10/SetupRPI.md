    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A PC running <a href="http://insider.windows.com" target="_blank">Windows 10 Insider Preview</a>.</li>
        <li>Register with the Microsoft Connect program to download the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview image.</br>
			We release the Windows 10 IoT Core for Raspberry Pi 2 through our program on Microsoft Connect. If you have not signed up yet, please go to our program site on <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/windowsembeddediot/SelfNomination.aspx?ProgramID=8558" target="_blank">Microsoft Connect</a> site to sign up. You can find step-by-step instructions for signing up for Microsoft Connect <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/SigninMSConnect.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. If you're already signed up for this program on Microsoft Connect and try to sign up again, you will just see a blank page.
        <li>Raspberry Pi 2.</li>
        <li>5V micro USB power supply with at least 1.0A current.</li>
			NOTE: You may want to use a higher current power supply (>2.0A) instead if you plan on using several USB peripherals or high-current devices.
        <li>A 8gb Class 10 (or better) micro SD card.</li>
			If you don't have an SD card, we suggest this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU786?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=as2&creative=374929&camp=211189">one</a> or this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Micro-SDHC-16GB/dp/9966573445/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1415926730&sr=8-15&keywords=micro+sd+xd">one</a>.
        <li>HDMI cable (if display is desired).</li>

    <h2>Put the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview image on your SD Card</h2>
    <p>We have provided a utility to provision your SD card with the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview.  The following steps can only be executed on a system running <a href="https://insider.windows.com">Windows 10</a> (build 10069 or higher).</p>
    <p>Follow these instructions to configure your SD card:</p>
    <ol class="word-wrap">
        <li>NOTE: you will need to follow these instructions on a physical Windows machine (and not a VM) because you need access to the SD card reader.</li>
        <li>Please download the package "Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview Image for Raspberry Pi 2" from the Microsoft Connect <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/windowsembeddedIoT/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=57782" target="_blank">here</a>. If you see a blank page or no downloads listed, please make sure you are signed into Microsoft Connect by looking at your login information at top right part of the screen. If you did not sign up to the Microsoft Connect program, please refer to the instructions in the "What you need" section above.</li>
        <li>Make a local copy of the flash.ffu contained in the downloaded package "Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview Image for Raspberry Pi 2".</li>
        <li>Insert an SD card into your SD card reader.</li>
        <li>Open an admininistrator command prompt and navigate to the folder containing your local flash.ffu.</li>
        <li>
            Find the disk number that your SD card is on your computer.  This will be used when the image is applied in the next step.  To do this, you can use the diskpart utility.  Run the following commands:<br />
            <kbd>diskpart</kbd><br />
            <kbd>list disk</kbd><br />
            <kbd>exit</kbd>
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the admininistrator command prompt, apply the image to your SD card by running the following command (be sure to replace PhysicalDriveN with the value you found in the previous step, for example, if your SD card is disk number 3, use <kbd>/ApplyDrive:\\.\PhysicalDrive3</kbd> below):<br />
            <kbd>dism.exe /Apply-Image /ImageFile:<fullpath>flash.ffu /ApplyDrive:\\.\PhysicalDriveN /SkipPlatformCheck</fullpath></kbd>
        </li>
        <li>Click on the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in your task tray and select your USB SD card reader to safely remove it from the system.  Failing to do this can cause corruption of the image.
        </li>

        <li>Connect a network cable to the Ethernet port on the board.</li>
        <li>Connect an HDMI monitor to the HDMI port on the board.</li>

    <h2>Boot Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview</h2>
    <ol class="word-wrap">
        <li>Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview will boot automatically after connecting power supply.</li>
        <li>On the very first boot the you will see a blue windows logo and then a black screen for a long time (2 minutes or longer).  Do not power off the board while it is doing first-time setup.  The board will then reboot to a blue-screened application that says “MinWin” at the top.  It will sit on this screen also for a long time (2 minutes or longer).  Again, do not power off the board while this is occurring.  Finally the board will reboot a second time to show DefaultApp, displaying the IP address of the Raspberry Pi 2.
