We use this easy to follow [Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) guide. Use the pygments option when you go through the install.\r\n\r\n### Iterating on documentation\r\n1. Using Command Prompt, from within the content folder start a local server:\r\n```jekyll serve --watch```\r\n1. If prompted by the firewall, allow Jekyll to serve content\r\n1. Open your web browser and point it to the local server. localhost:4000 is the default\r\n1. Now you have your own version of the documentation site!\r\n1. You can make changes to the pages using your favorite text editor.\r\n\r\n### Documentation rules\r\n* For samples, please use [Jekyll's Kramdown flavored Markdown](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to get nice formatting when rendered as a webpage.\r\n* For README.md files, please use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) to get nice formatting on the file browser.\r\n* Please do not use HTML\r\n* For samples, please append ```{:target=\"_blank\"}```, so the link opens in a new page\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
