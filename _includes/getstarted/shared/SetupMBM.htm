    <h3>Update Your Device Firmware</h3>
    <ol class="inline-list "">
      <li>Download the latest 32-Bit Release pre-built BIOS firmware from <a href="http://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max"
          target="_blank"> firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max </a> <br>For the current release, only 32 bit is supported,
        however if you have a new board or are currently running the 64-bit firmware you will need to download <u>both</u>        the 64 and the 32 bit versions and use the 64 bit instructions below. </li>
      <li>
        Unzip the downloaded file and copy the following files to a FAT formatted USB stick
        <ul>
          <li>*.efi</li>
          <li>*.bin</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Power off your MinnowBoard</li>
      <li>Remove any SD cards and external hard drives</li>
      <li>Plug in the USB stick to the MinnowBoard</li>
      <li>Power on your MinnowBoard</li>
      <li>
        You should see the UEFI prompt. Run the following commands at the UEFI prompt:
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your current firmware is 64 bit (this is how the MinnowBoard ships)</p>
        <kbd>fs0:</kbd>
        <kbd>.\MinnowBoard.MAX.FirmwareUpdateX64.efi _filename_.bin</kbd>
        <p> If your current firmware is 32 bit (if you have already modified the original firmware to be 32 bit) </p>
        <kbd>fs0:</kbd>
        <kbd>.\MinnowBoard.MAX.FirmwareUpdateIA32.efi _filename_.bin</kbd>
        <p> e.g. </p>
        <kbd>Shell> fs0:</kbd>
        <kbd>fs0:\> .\MinnowBoard.MAX.FirmwareUpdateIA32.efi MinnowBoard.MAX.I32.079.R01.bin</kbd>
      </li>
      <li>
        The system should shut down automatically after the firmware update is complete.
        <ul>
          <li> NOTE: If you are not able to go to the fs0: partition, try a different flash drive. Certain flash drives won't
            be bootable even after you copy efi/bin files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> You might wonder why you need to invoke 'MinnowBoard.MAX.FirmwareUpdateX64.efi' even if we're only supporting a 32 bit
      version of Windows 10 IoT Core. The board usually comes with 64-bit firmware pre-installed on it. The bitness of the
      EFI has to match the bitness of the current firmware. Additionally, the bitness of the bin file has to match the desired
      bitness of the firmware after updating. So the first time you will likely need to use 64-bit EFI and 32-bit BIN. The
      second time and every other time you need to use 32-bit EFI and 32-bit BIN. The reason the bitness of the firmware
      has to match the bitness of the OS is that there is an EFI in the OS image that gets loaded to bootstrap the OS, and
      that EFI has to be the same bitness as the firmware as well.
