    <p>Quick-Run samples are pre-built and require no compiling or coding to get going. This is a great way to make sure everything is working and easily play with your board.</p>
    <ol class="inline-list">
      <li><b>Navigate to "Quick-run samples"</b> in the left nav bar.</li>
      <li><b>Select a sample.</b></li> 
      <li>
        <b>Select your board from the drop down list and launch the sample.</b>  In the background, the dashboard will temporarily install the quick-run sample onto your device. Once loaded, the device will broadcast a webpage over the network and IoT Dashboard will automatically connect to it. This lets you control the app without having to plug in a monitor directly to your device.
