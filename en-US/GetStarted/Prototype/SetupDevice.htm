                    To install Windows 10 IoT Core onto your boards (Raspberry Pi) using NOOBS, you'll need to have a micro SD card formatted with NOOBS. If you already have a SD card pre-imaged with NOOBS, you can skip to learning more about connecting to a network. Otherwise, you'll need to download the latest version of NOOBS from the <a class="c-hyperlink" href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/noobs-install">official NOOBS download</a> site.
