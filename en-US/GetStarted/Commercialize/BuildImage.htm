    <h1  class="c-subheading-1">Build your image</h1>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">To get started, we'll create a basic IoT Core image, flash it to a micro SD card, and put it into a device to make sure that everything is working properly.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">We'll create a product folder that represents our first design. For our first product design, we'll customize just enough for the IoT Core device to boot up and run the built-in OOBE app, which we should be able to see on an HDMI-compatible monitor.</p>

    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">1. Set your OEM name (one-time only)</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Open the file below in a text editor and modify it with your company name or name of choosing.</p>

    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">2. Start the IoT Core shell</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">In Windows Explorer, go to the folder where you installed the IoT Core ADK Add-Ons and open IoTCoreShell.cmd. It should prompt you to run as an administrator. The new value for OEM_NAME should appear when you start the tool.</p>

    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">3. Install test certificates</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">You only need to install certificates the first time you install the IoT ADK add-on kit. You'll use these to sign your test binaries. The certificates will be added to the root.</p>

    <p class="c-paragraph-3">At the "Set Environment for Architecture" prompt, select 1 for ARM, 2 for x86 or 3 for x64 based on the architecture of the boards you'll be developing.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">Note: The launch tool sets the default architecture, and sets a version number for the design, which you can use for future updates. The first version number defaults to 10.0.0.0.</p>

    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">5. Build your board supported package (BSP)</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Get the BSP packages for your platform and build them as per the instructions given by the BSP vendor. See the <a class="c-hyperlink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/build-your-image/createbsps">Windows 10 IoT Core BSP page</a> for info on available BSPs. </p>

    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Eject any removable storage drives including the Micro SD card and any USB flash drives. Build a flashable test image using the default files. Test images include additional tools which will help to create test images using either signed or unsigned test packages.</p>
