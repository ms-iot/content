  <p class="c-paragraph-3">After you've chosen a silicon to work with, picking the right platform to commercialize with is the next important step. Microsoft works alongside Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm to verify support for Windows 10 IoT Core on several of the silicon vendors' System on Chips (SoCs). </p>

  <p class="c-paragraph-3">These IoT Core-powered SoCs are used in hundreds of different devices that you can use to commercialize your idea.
For more information on our SoC Partners, as well as where to download Board Support Packages (BSPs) for certain boards and devices, please read our documentation on <a class="c-hyperlink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/learn-about-hardware/suggestedboards">suggested boards and SoCs</a>.</p>
