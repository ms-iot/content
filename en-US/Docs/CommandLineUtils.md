# Windows 10 IoT Core Command Line Utils

Looking to configure some of the settings on your device? The below tools all come pre-installed on your device to help you with that! Use PowerShell to run these commands after [connecting to your device]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell).

* **Update account password:**

	It is highly recommended that you update the default password for the Administrator account. To do this, you can issue the following command: `net user Administrator [new password]` where `[new password]` represents a strong password of your choice.

* **Create local user accounts:**

	If you wish to give others access to your Windows IoT Core device, you can create additional local user accounts using PS by typing in `net user [username] [password] /add`. If you wish to add this user to other groups, such as the Administrator group, use `net localgroup Administrators [username] /add`.

* **Set password**

	To change the password on an account on your device, run `net user [account-username] [new-password]` to change the account password.

* **Query and set device name:**

	To identify your current device name, simply type `hostname`. To change the name of your Windows IoT Core device, type `SetComputerName [new machinename]`. You may need to restart your device for the name change to take effect.

* **Basic network configuration:**

	Many of the basic network configuration utilities you may already be familiar with are available in Windows IoT Core, including commands such as `ping.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `netsh.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `tracert.exe`, and `arp.exe`.

* **Copy utilities:**

	Microsoft is providing familiar tools, including `sfpcopy.exe` as well as `xcopy.exe`.

* **Process Management:**

	To view currently running processes, you can try either `get-process` or alternatively `tlist.exe`. To stop a running process, type `kill.exe [pid or process name]`.

* **Setting startup app:**

	Use the startup editor to configure startup apps on your Windows IoT Core device. Run `IotStartup` with any of the following options:

	* `IotStartup list` lists installed applications

    * `IotStartup list headed` lists installed headed applications

    * `IotStartup list headless` lists installed headless applications

    * `IotStartup list [MyApp]` list installed applications that match pattern `MyApp`

    * `IotStartup add` adds headed and headless applications

    * `IotStartup add headed [MyApp]` adds headed applications that match pattern `MyApp`.  Pattern must match only one application.

    * `IotStartup add headless [Task1]` adds headless applications that match pattern `Task1`

    * `IotStartup remove` removes headed and headless applications

    * `IotStartup remove headed [MyApp]` removes headed applications that match pattern `MyApp`

    * `IotStartup remove headless [Task1]` removes headless applications that match pattern `Task1`

    * `IotStartup startup` lists headed and headless applications registered for startup

    * `IotStartup startup [MyApp]` lists headed and headless applications registered for startup that match pattern `MyApp`

    * `IotStartup startup headed [MyApp]` lists headed applications registered for startup that match `MyApp`

    * `IotStartup startup headless [Task1]` lists headless applications registered for startup that match `Task1`

	* For further help, try `IotStartup help`

* **Set Boot Option (Headless vs. headed boot):**

	Windows IoT Core devices can be set to headed (when display capabilities are required) or headless (when a display is not required or available) device mode. To change this setting, use `setbootoption.exe [headed | headless]`.

		NOTE: Changing this setting will require a reboot in order for the change to take effect.

* **Task scheduler:**

	To view the current list of scheduled tasks, use the `schtasks.exe` command. You can create new tasks with the `/create` switch or run on-demand tasks with the `/run` switch. For a full list of supported parameters, use `schtasks.exe /?`

* **Device drivers:**

	The device console utility is useful in identifying and managing installed devices and drivers. For a full list of parameters, use `devcon.exe /?`

* **Registry Access:**

	If you need to access the registry to view or modify settings, use the `reg.exe /?` Command for the full list of supported parameters.

* **Services:**

	Managing Windows services can be accomplished via the `net.exe` command. To see a list of running services, type `net start`. To start or stop a specific service, type `net [start | stop] [service name]`. Alternatively, you can also use the service control manager via `sc.exe` command.

* **Boot configuration:**

	You can make changes to the boot configuration of your Windows IoT Core device by using `bcdedit.exe`. For instance, you can enable testsigning with `bcdedit â€“set testsigning on` command.

* **Shutdown/restart device:**

	To shut down your device, type `shutdown /s /t 0`. To restart the device, use the `/r` switch instead with the command `shutdown /r /t 0`.

* **Set display resolution**

	To adjust the resolution of a display connected to your Windows 10 IoT Core device, run `SetDisplayResolution [width] [height]`. To query the resolution, exclude the `[width]` and `[height]` parameters.

* **Take screenshot**

	You can take the screenshot of your Windows IoTCore device by using `ScreenCapture.exe`. For example, run `ScreenCapture c:\folder\screencap.jpg` will take the screenshot and save it in screencap.jpg file.

* **Get information about Network Adapters**

	To view the list of all the available network adapters, run `GetAdapterInfo` tool.

* **Set folder permissions for UWP apps**

	Not all folders on your device are accesible by Universal Windows Apps. To make a folder accesible to a UWP app, you can use `FolderPermissions` tool. For example run `FolderPermissions c:\test -e` to give UWP apps access to `c:\test` folder. Note this will work only with native Win32 apis for eg. CreateFile2 and not with WinRT apis like StorageFolder, StorageFile etc.

* **Change default audio device and volume**

  The `IoTCoreAudioControlTool` tool controls audio related options, such as setting default capture and playback devices and changing the volume. For a full list of parameters, run `IoTCoreAudioControlTool h`.
