  <p>To set up Windows 10 IoT Core, you need to use the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard.</p>
  <ol class="inline-list">
    <li><b>Launch Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard</b>. If you haven't already, <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/GetStarted" target="_blank">install Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard</a>. Note that you must have Windows 10 or better.</li>
    <li><b>Click "Set up a new device"</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Select your device type from the dropdown</b>. Each board has its own specialized image that differs per board.</li>
    <li><b>Make sure your SD card is compliant</b>. We require that the SD card be at least 8 GB in size. Slower and older cards have a tendency to be inconsistent when flashing and may fail to work.
    For best results, use our suggested cards in our <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/Docs/HardwareCompatList.htm#Storage" target="_blank">compatibility list</a>.</li> 
    <li><b>Download and install</b>. A window will pop up to show you the progress of the flashing. This can take several minutes depending on the speed of your card.</li> 
    <li><b>Plug the SD card into your board and power on</b>. You have the option to plug in a display, but it is not necessary. For best results, plug it in before you power on the device. First boot will take several minutes as the Operating System does its initial installation.</li>
