# Windows Device Portal
   The Windows Device Portal (WDP) lets you configure and manage your device remotely over a network.
   The main features are documented on the [Windows Device Portal overview page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal)

![Device Portal Home]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/deviceportal/deviceportal.png)

## Shared Documentation
___
WDP is a developer tool shared among all Windows 10 devices. Each product has it's unique features, but the core functionality is the same.
Documentation for the main features are found on the [Windows Device Portal overview page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal)
The rest of the documentation below will be IoT specific.

## Set up
___
1. Connect your board to the internet

    To get WDP up and running, you first need to connect your device to your network. See the [Get Started]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/GetStarted) page for full instructions.

2. Find your device in IoT Dashboard and connect.
   Right click and select **Open in Device Portal**.

   You can enter the IP address into your browser. Add :8080 onto the end.![Browser IP]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/DevicePortal/browser_ip.png)
    
3. Enter your credentials
    Unless changed, the default credentials are:

    Username: `Administrator`
    Password: `p@ssw0rd`
    
   
    

## IoT specific features
___

### Apps
Provides install/uninstall functionality for AppX packages and bundles on your device.
{% include imageborder.html alt="App list" link="/Resources/images/DevicePortal/AppList.png" %}
IoT Core is unique in that it only allows one foreground app to run at one time. The app list is modified to ensure that this is the case. Under the **STARTUP** column, you can select as many background applications to start by default, but can only set one foreground application.  

### App File Explorer
The app file explorer shows the directories that your apps can access.

* CameraRoll is shared among all apps
* Documents is shared among all apps
* LocalAppData contains folders specific to each app. This folder will be the same name as your app and other apps cannot access it.

### Debugging

#### Kernel dumps
{% include imageborder.html alt="App list" link="/Resources/images/DevicePortal/Debug1.png" %}
Any system crashes will automatically be logged and available to view through the web management tool.  You can then download the kernel dump and try to figure out what's going on.

#### Process dumps
{% include imageborder.html alt="App list" link="/Resources/images/DevicePortal/Debug2.png" %}
This is similar to Live kernel dumps, but for the user mode processes. 
Clicking the **download** button will cause a 'minidump', and the entire state of that process will be downloaded. This is good for debugging hanging processes.

#### Kernel crash settings

### Bluetooth
This page shows you all the bluetooth paired devices and all the devices which are discoverable. To pair with another Bluetooth device, put the device in pairing mode and wait for it to appear in the available devices list.  
{% include imageborder.html alt="App list" link="/Resources/images/DevicePortal/Bluetooth.png" %}

Click on **Pair link** to pair the device. If the device requires a PIN for pairing, it will pop-up a message box displaying the PIN. Once the device is paired, it will show up in the Paired devices list. You can un-pair the device by clicking on **Remove**. 

Once you navigate to the Bluetooth page, your device will be discoverable by other devices. You can also find it from your PC/Phone and pair it from there.

More information on bluetooth can be found on the [bluetooth page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823223).

### IoT Onboarding

IoT Onboarding provides support for configuring an IoT device's Wi-Fi connectivity options.

** Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) **
Internet Connection Sharing allows you to share the Internet access of your device with other devices connected to your device over the Wi-Fi SoftAP.  
To use this feature, your Windows 10 IoT Device needs to have access to the internet (e.g. through a wired LAN connection), an *Access Point Adapter* must be chosen (e.g. a Wi-Fi Adapter) and the SoftAP needs to be enabled.   You also need to start shared access.  Once started, connect a separate Wi-Fi enabled device to the SoftAP on your Windows 10 IoT device.  After a connection is established your separate Wi-Fi enabled device will be able to connect to the internet through your Windows 10 IoT device.

** SoftAP Settings **
The SoftAP Settings allow you to control whether or not your device's SoftAP is enabled.  It also provides a means for configuring your SoftAP's SSID and the WPA2-PSK key which are necessary to connect the SoftAP from another device.

** AllJoyn Onboarding Settings **
The AllJoyn Onboarding Settings allow you to control whether or not your device's Wi-Fi connection can configured through your device's AllJoyn Onboarding Producer.  When a separate device running an AllJoyn Onboarding Consumer application connects to your Windows 10 IoT SoftAP, the AllJoyn Onboarding Consumer application can be used to configure your IoT device's Wi-Fi adapter.  When enabled, the AllJoyn Onboarding Producer app (IoTOnboarding) uses the ECDHE_NULL authentication method.

{% include note.html text='To use the AllJoyn Onboarding Settings, this requires an update to the <strong>IotOnboarding</strong> sample which may be <a href="https://github.com/ms-iot/samples">downloaded here</a>.' %}

### TPM configuration
The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptographic coprocessor including capabilities for random number generation, secure generation of cryptographic keys and limitation of their use. It also includes capabilities such as remote attestation and sealed storage. To learn about the TPM and security on IoT Core, visit the [Building secure devices]({{site.baseurl}}/en-US/Docs/BuildingSecureDevices) page and the [TPM]({{site.baseurl}}/en-US/Docs/TPM) page.

### Remote
The Windows IoT Remote Server allows users to see what their device is displaying without connecting a physical monitor to the keyboard.
 


## Additional Information
___

### Changing the default port
1. Launch powershell and [connect to your device.]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell)
2. Set the port:

    `Reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\IoT\webmanagement /v HttpPort /t REG_DWORD /d <your port number>`
	
3. If you want to set the https port

	`Reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\IoT\webmanagement /v UseHttps /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
	
	`Reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\IoT\webmanagement /v HttpsPort /t REG_DWORD /d <your port number> /f`
	
3. Restart the process by restarting service (```net stop webmanagement & net start webmanagement```) it or rebooting the device.
