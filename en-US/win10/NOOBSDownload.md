### Downloading 

Upon accepting the licensing agreement, you should see the downloading progress dialog similar to the one below.

**NOTE:** Windows 10 IoT Core is a very large file to download over the Internet so it's not unusual for this process to take an extended period of time.

After the download has completed successfully, you should see a confirmation dialog as shown below:

Once you have successfully installed Windows 10 IoT Core via NOOBS on your operating system partition, your device will automatically reboot. 

### Booting Windows
If everything worked properly you should now see the Windows boot screen followed by the following on the monitor connected to your Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 device:

You may now use your Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 device.

**NOTE:** Raspberry Pi 3 devices will still say Raspberry Pi 2 on this page - please disregard.
