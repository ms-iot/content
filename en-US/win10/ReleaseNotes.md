#Release Notes for Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview
&copy; 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved

This document provides late-breaking or other information that supplements the documentation included with the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview.

Thank you for downloading the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview.  Windows 10 IoT Core is the version of Windows 10 intended for development of
embedded or dedicated purpose devices and the choice for the Maker community. This package contains the bits and tools needed to install a pre-release of
Windows 10 IoT Core on the MinnowBoard Max based on Intel Atom E38xx series SoC (also referred to as MBM board) and the Raspberry PI2 based on
the ARM Cortex-A7 based SoC (also referred to as the RPI).

##Privacy Statement

The privacy statement for this pre-release version of the Windows operating system can be viewed here: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506737](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=506737){:target="_blank"}

##What's New
* Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview 5/12 Release

    * Updated base OS build
    * Updated login-based web interface for device setup, startup application configuration, and feedback capabilities.

##Release Notes

The default administrator user name and password are hard coded in the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview image. This is a security risk for the
device, and it should not be exposed to an open internet connection until the password has been changed.

The Windows 10 IoT Core image included in this drop supports the peripherals that are exposed on the MinnowBoard MAX board. Subsequently, IntelÆ
will provide support of the full feature set of the Baytrail processors including the IntelÆ CeleronÆ Processors J1900/N2930/N2807 and IntelÆ AtomÆ Processors E38XX.

Windows 10 IoT Core is still being ported to the Raspberry PI. Support for audio input and output on the RPI is still under development and does
not exist at all in this release. The video driver for the Raspberry PI is still under development, and it's performance has not yet been optimized.
Animated user elements, such as XAML based drop down menus, in particular may display poorly.

Bluetooth connectivity is not fully implemented on either the MinnowBoard Max or the Raspberry PI2 for this release.

Wireless networking is not fully implemented on the Raspberry PI2 for this release.

##Known Issues

* The keyboard input may be lost when switching between multiple apps that are running at the same time. (1304429)
* Some USB keyboards and mice may not work on the Raspberry PI2. (2365290). WORKAROUND: Use a different keyboard or mouse. This issue has been seen with a few specific models and is suspected to be a power issue with the USB port. This may resolve by using a powered USB hub.

* Once the GPIO wake feature is enabled in the UEFI settings of Device Manager it may not be possible to toggle any GPIO outputs or read GPIO values using the GPIO WinRT APIs(1894235). WORKAROUND: Do not enable the GPIO wake feature in Device Manager.
* The GPIO interrupt handler can drift out of sync with the actual state of the GPIO pins when a button is attached or when the interrupts occur at a faster rate than the system can process them.. WORKAROUND: Reduce the frequency of the interrupts.
* The GPIO interrupts may become spurious when the drive mode of a GPIO pin is changed. (2116871). WORKAROUND: None
