## Release Notes

The default administrator user name and password are hard coded in the Windows 10 IoT Core image. This is a security risk for the device, and it should not be exposed to an open internet connection until the password has been changed.

The MinnowBoard Max will not boot unless the firmware is version .082 or later. The minimum recommended version of the firmware is "MinnowBoard MAX 0.83 32-Bit". Firmware updates can be downloaded from [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=708613](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=708613){:target="_blank"}.

The Windows 10 IoT Core image included in this drop supports the peripherals that are exposed on the MinnowBoard MAX board. Subsequently, Intel&reg; will provide support of the full feature set of the Baytrail processors including the Intel Celeron&trade; Processors J1900/N2930/N2807 and Intel Atom&trade; Processors E38XX.

On the DragonBoard, a shutdown command will not power off the board. The system will restart. Please power off the board by disconnecting the power.

Windows 10 UWP projects created with Visual Studio RC are not compatible with the current Visual Studio release. Users should create a new blank UWP project or Background Application (IoT) project and copy their source code into the new project. 

Windows 10 IoT Core is still being ported to the Raspberry PI. The video driver for the Raspberry PI is still under development, and its performance has not yet been optimized. Animated user elements, such as XAML based drop down menus in particular, may display poorly. 

With this release of Windows 10 IoT Core for the Raspberry Pi 2, support for camera peripheral devices is limited. The PiCam device directly connected to the onboard camera bus is not currently supported, as it requires GPU services that are not currently available on the Raspberry Pi because the DirectX driver has not been implemented. Modern USB webcams produce data streams that are very demanding on the USB Host controller.  Even when used with low resolution settings webcams will require additional USB fine tuning and specialized control logic. We are planning to support a number of USB cameras in the near future and will publish specific information on supported devices as soon as possible.

Hardware volume controls for USB microphones and speakers which depend on Windows system to change system volume are currently not supported on Windows 10 IoT Core.

Some USB keyboards and mice may not work on the Raspberry PI2. Use a different keyboard or mouse. A list of validated peripheral devices can be found on the documentation at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=619428](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=619428){:target="_blank"}.

On the Raspberry Pi2 the GPIO pin 0 and GPIO pin 1 were available to user mode applications in the April Insider Preview release of version of Windows 10 IoT Core, but are no longer available. Attempting to open these pins with Windows::Devices::Gpio::GpioController::OpenPin() will return HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_NOT_FOUND). GPIO pins 0 and 1 are reserved on the Raspberry Pi by the HAT specification (https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats) and are under control of VC firmware. For compliance with this specification, these pins should be left unconnected.


## Known Issues

*	Windows Device Portal may stop working after a day of continuous uptime. (5458435) WORKAROUND: Restart the device.
*	Setting the orientation to "Portrait" may not be honored in a Universal App (3039042) WORKAROUND: None

### <a name="ftdiworkaround"></a>Workaround for FTDI devices on x86

 1. Plug in the FTDI device to your MBM.
 2. Run `devcon status FTDIBUS\*` and note the *device instance path* of your device.

    <pre>
        C:\Data>devcon status ftdibus\*
        <i>FTDIBUS\VID_0403+PID_6001+A700EXHLA\0000</i>
            Name: USB Serial Port
            Driver is running.
        1 matching device(s) found.
    </pre>

 3. Create a file named ftdi-fix.reg with the following contents, where `<device instance path>` is replaced with the device instance path determined in the previous step.

{% highlight registry %}
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\controlset001\enum\<device instance path>\Device Parameters]
"ConfigData"=hex:11,00,3f,3f,10,27,00,00,88,13,00,00,c4,09,00,00,e2,04,00,00,\
  71,02,00,00,38,41,00,00,9c,80,00,00,4e,c0,00,00,34,00,00,00,1a,00,00,00,0d,\
  00,00,00,06,40,00,00,03,80,00,00,00,00,00,00,d0,80,00,00
"LatencyTimer"=dword:00000010
"MinReadTimeout"=dword:00000000
"MinWriteTimeout"=dword:00000000
{% endhighlight %}

 4. Copy ftdi-fix.reg to your device and run `reg import ftdi-fix.reg` to apply the registry keys.
 5. Unplug and replug the FTDI device.
 
### <a name="wifidirect"></a>WiFi Direct limitations on IoTCore

1. The IoTCore device has to be the connecting device â€“ it will not work as the advertising device with another device initiating the connection.  
2. Advanced pairing must be used.  The sample app demonstrates how to use the advanced pairing APIâ€™s to pair the devices prior to connecting.
3. Not all wireless adapters support WiFi direct. We have tested and validated that the "Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless Lan 802.11n USB 2.0 Network adapter" works, but other adapters may not be supported.
