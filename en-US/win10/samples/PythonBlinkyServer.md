##Python Blinky Server Sample

We'll create a simple Python Blinky Web Server app and connect a LED to your Windows 10 IoT Core device (Raspberry Pi 2 or MinnowBoard Max).  Be aware that the GPIO APIs are
only available on Windows IoT Core, so this sample cannot run on your desktop.

###Set up your PC
* Follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/SetupPC.htm) to install Visual Studio 2015 Preview.

* Install Python for Windows (3.*) from [http://www.python.org/downloads](http://www.python.org/downloads){:target="_blank"}

* Download and install PTVS (Python Tools for Visual Studio) **VS 2015** latest dev release from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvs/releases){:target="_blank"}.

* Download and install Python UWP SDK (pyuwpsdk.vsix) from [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/python/releases/v1.0Alpha){:target="_blank"}.

###Set up your hardware
The setup for this sample is the same as the C# 'Blinky' [sample]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/samples/Blinky.htm).

###Headless mode

This application is designed for a headless device.  To better understand what Headless mode is and how to configure your device to be headless, follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/HeadlessMode.htm).

###Load the project in Visual Studio

You can find this sample [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/BlinkyServer/Python/PythonBlinkyServer).  Make a copy of the folder on your disk and open the project from Visual Studio.

If you're building for MinnowBoard Max, select `x86` in the architecture drop down.  If you're building for Raspberry Pi 2, select `ARM`.

Make sure you connect the LED to your board. Go back to the basic 'Blinky' [sample]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/samples/Blinky.htm) if you need guidance.

Note that the app will not run successfully if it cannot find any available GPIO ports.

###Let's look at the code
The code for this sample is pretty simple. We use _wingpio, http.server and socketserver modules.

*NOTE: _wingpio reference is already added to the project and is conditioned on the different configuration and platform combinations*

###Blinky code
Here is how you set up the blinking led in Python when the web server is hit:
{% highlight Python %}
import http.server
import socketserver
import _wingpio as gpio

led_pin = 5
led_status = gpio.HIGH

gpio.setup(led_pin, gpio.OUT, gpio.PUD_OFF, led_status)

class BlinkyRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_HEAD(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/plain")
        self.end_headers()
    def do_GET(self):
        global led_status
        if led_status == gpio.LOW:
            self.wfile.write(b"Setting pin to HIGH")
            print('Setting pin to HIGH')
            led_status = gpio.HIGH
        else:
            self.wfile.write(b"Setting pin to LOW")
            print('Setting pin to LOW')
            led_status = gpio.LOW
        gpio.output(led_pin, led_status)

httpd = http.server.HTTPServer(("", 8000), BlinkyRequestHandler)
print('Started web server on port %d' % httpd.server_address[1])
httpd.serve_forever()

{% endhighlight %}

Remember that we connected the other end of the LED to the 3.3 Volts power supply, so we need to drive the pin to low to have current flow into the LED.

###Deploy Python app to your Windows 10 IoT Core device

* Right-click the Project node and select Properties

* Make sure you set the 'Remote Machine' setting to point to your device. Go back to the basic Python [sample]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/samples/Python.htm) if you need guidance.

**NOTE: For now, use device name in lieu of IP address.  If the device name is not unique, use `setcomputername` tool on the device to reset the device name and reboot.  Documentation for this can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/win10/samples/PowerShell.htm)**

* When everything is set up, you should be able to press F5 from Visual Studio: The Python app will deploy and start on the device.

**NOTE: Launching the debugger for Python can take a few minutes to connect and start debugging the remote Python.  If it takes more than a few minutes, there may be a problem with msvsmon on the remote device.  Please check the FAQ for any potential fixes/workarounds.**

* Once you see the message about the web server being started, you can hit the address in a browser to see the LED toggle (http://<yourdeviceip>:8000)
