    <p>There are currently two ways to get connected depending on what kind of equipment you have; WiFi and ethernet. <b>Connecting via Ethernet is recommended</b> because of it’s reliability.</p>
    <p>Connect via ethernet:</p>
    <ol class="inline-list">
      <li><b>Connect an Ethernet cable from your network into your board.</b> The board will automatically connect to your network.</li>
      <li><b>Go to "My Devices".</b> From my devices, you can discover your device and configure it (including connecting to Wi-Fi).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Connect via Wi-Fi:</p>
    <ol class="inline-list">
      <li><b>Go to "My devices".</b> my devices, you can dsicover your device and configure it (including connecting to Wi-Fi).</li>  
      <li><b>Find your board and click "Configure Device".</b> If your board has a WiFi adapater and it has not yet be set up, it will start to broadcast itself as a network (shown in the figure to the right). Unconfigured boards will begin with "AJ_" (e.g. AJ_58EA6C68).
      If you don’t see your board, make sure that you’ve allowed enough time for your board to boot. If all else fails, reboot your device.
      <li><b>Enter your network credentials.</b> Your computer will now connect to your board.</li> 
    </ol>
