<p>We are excited to announce that you can immediately download Windows IoT Core for use on your Raspberry Pi 3 that offers the following benefits:</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Functional parity with RPi2, including Windows as a service updating and flighting model and a single FFU for RPi2 and RPi3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open sourcing Pi BSP to encourage community innovation/speed and support commercialization efforts</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="coming-soon-in-a-future-release-of-windows-iot-core-insider-preview">Coming Soon in a future release of Windows IoT Core Insider Preview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Onboard WiFi &amp; Bluetooth, but in the meantime you can still use <a href="/content/en-US/win10/SupportedInterfaces.htm">a compatible USB WiFi/Bluetooth dongle</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functionality for unique innovation, including remote app UI to a phone or windows device, remoting of sensors and actuators from a windows device via UWP and closed loop control capable hardware interrupts via Arduino Wiring and our high performance driver.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-different">What’s different?</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, so it is worth noting that GPIO pins 35 &amp; 47 as well as the onboard LED have been removed from the Raspberry Pi 3. Any projects you’ve built using this will only work with the Raspberry Pi 2.</p>
