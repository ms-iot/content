  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open sourcing Pi BSP to encourage community innovation/speed and support commercialization efforts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Onboard WiFi drivers are now enabled for the Raspberry Pi 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>

</ul>

<h2 id="whats-different">What’s different?</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, so it is worth noting that GPIO pins 35 &amp; 47 as well as the onboard LED have been removed from the Raspberry Pi 3. Any projects you’ve built using this will only work with the Raspberry Pi 2.</p>
