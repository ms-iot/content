<p>We are excited to announce that you can immediately download Windows IoT Core for use on your Raspberry Pi 3 that offers the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Functional parity with RPi2, including Windows as a service updating and flighting model and a single FFU for RPi2 and RPi3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open sourcing Pi BSP to encourage community innovation/speed and support commercialization efforts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Onboard WiFi drivers are now enabled for the Raspberry Pi 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UART/Serial (miniUART) driver for the Raspberry PI 3 onboard serial is now enabled for the Raspberry Pi 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pin muxing support, increasing the number of available GPIO pins from 17 to 24.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional SPI bus (SPI1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased UART baud rate support (was 115200, now 921600).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>20% increase in GPIO performance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Onboard Bluetooth, but in the meantime you can still use <a href="/content/en-US/win10/SupportedInterfaces.htm">a compatible USB Bluetooth dongle</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-different">What’s different?</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, so it is worth noting that GPIO pins 35 &amp; 47 as well as the onboard LED have been removed from the Raspberry Pi 3. Any projects you’ve built using this will only work with the Raspberry Pi 2.</p>
