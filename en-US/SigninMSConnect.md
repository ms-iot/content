<h1>Signing into Microsoft Connect</h1>
<hr/>
Before downloading any software, you must sign up for the Windows Developer Program for IoT on Microsoft Connect. This is a necessary step in order to download the WindowsDeveloperProgramforIOT.msi and other program files.
<br/><br/>
Microsoft Connect facilitates a unified hosting service for file downloads and provides users with an interface for reporting potential bugs and valuable feedback in our product. The flow of the Microsoft Connect sign-up process can vary based on a number of circumstances.
<br/><br/>
Choose the relevant drop-down option below to receive instructions on the process.

        Upon completing the sign-up form for a Microsoft Account email, you will be directed to the original intended destination of the link – the Microsoft Connect Registration web site.  It will look like the image included here:
        <br/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/MSConnectRegistration.png"><br/><br/>
        Click the "Continue" button to move on to a social.microsoft.com web page – on this site, you will need to enter a Public Identity Display Name that can be used to post content on our Microsoft Connect site.

        After choosing a Display Name and agreeing to the terms of the site, click the "Continue" button to move on to a profile.microsoft.com web page.
        <br/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/MSConnectProfileRegister.png"><br/><br/>

Fill out the information on the form and click the "Submit" button.  At this point, your Microsoft Connect profile has been created and you'll be redirected to the site where we host our EULA agreement for the MSI.  This site looks like this:

	    You should notice the public Display Name you chose earlier in the top-right corner of the web page – you've successfully created your Microsoft Connect profile.  Now, click on the Survey Title "MICROSOFT WINDOWS FOR WINDOWS DEVELOPER PROGRAM FOR IOT EULA" to read and accept the EULA.  Note the radio buttons at the very bottom of the EULA form, and choose either "I Accept" or "I Decline" accordingly.  Then, press "Submit" to submit the EULA.  This will take you to the Completed Registration page, pictured here:
        <br/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/MSConnectEULAThankYou.png"><br/><br/>
        If you want to download the MSI immediately, you can click the "Return to the connection home page" to visit the Windows Developer Program for IoT home page on Microsoft Connect.  The page will look this this:
        <br/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/MSConnectWOD.png"><br/><br/>
	    By clicking the "Downloads" link, you will be directed to the web site that hosts all of the available downloads associated with our program.  You're free to download any of them, including a text version of the EULA you just signed to finish registration, but you're looking to download the MSI.  To do so, click the link circled in red below.
        <br/><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/MSConnectDownload.png"><br/><br/>
