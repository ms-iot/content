# Blinky Sample



We'll create a simple LED blinking app and connect a LED to your Windows 10 IoT Core device.

This is a headed sample.  To better understand what headed mode is and how to configure your device to be headed, follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/HeadlessMode).

Also, be aware that the GPIO APIs are only available on Windows 10 IoT Core, so this sample cannot run on your desktop.

### Load the project in Visual Studio

You can find the source code for this sample by downloading a zip of all of our samples [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/archive/develop.zip) and navigating to the `samples-develop\Blinky`.  The sample code is available in either C++ or C#, however the documentation here only details the C# variant. Make a copy of the folder on your disk and open the project from Visual Studio.
