# Potentiometer sensor for Arduino
This sample shows how to connect a rotary potentiometer and LED to a Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 or a MinnowBoard Max using Arduino Wiring. We use a SPI-based ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) to read values from the potentiometer and control an LED based on the knob position.

This sample is similar to the [C# Potentiometer Sample]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Samples/Potentiometer), but uses Arduino Wiring instead of C#. The wiring and hardware configuration will be nearly identical. However, DragonBoard 410c does not currently support Arduino Wiring.

## Hardware
- Board - one of the following only
	- Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
	- MinnowBoard Max
- ADC - one of the following only
	- [1 MCP3002 10-bit ADC](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=MCP3002){:target="_blank"} or
	- [1 MCP3008 10-bit ADC](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010530){:target="_blank"} or
	- [1 MCP3208 12-bit ADC](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?KeyWords=mcp3208%20ci%2Fp&WT.z_header=search_go){:target="_blank"}
- [1 LED](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/C5SMF-RJS-CT0W0BB1/C5SMF-RJS-CT0W0BB1-ND/2341832){:target="_blank"}
- [1 330 &#x2126; resistor](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CFR-25JB-52-330R/330QBK-ND/1636){:target="_blank"}
- [1 10k &#x2126; Trimmer Potentiometer](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/3362P-1-103TLF/3362P-103TLF-ND/1232540){:target="_blank"} or similar
- 1 breadboard and an assortment of wires

## Hardware Setup

In this sample, you have the option of using either the MCP3002, MCP3008, or MCP3208 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). 
The differences between the chips are the number of input channels and resolution. 12-bit resolution is more accurate than the 10-bit options, and the number of channels determines how many different inputs you can read. Any of these options will work fine for this sample. 

Below are the pinouts of the MCP3002 and MCP3208 ADCs.

## Code

Replace the existing code in your main .ino file with the following code:

{% highlight C++ %}

/*
 * we'll set this channel number to match the channel we've plugged our potentiometer's
 * wiper pin into. In this case, channel 0 (C0). If you use a different channel,
 * you'll need to update this number.
 */
int channel = 0;

void setup()
{
    /*
     * it is not necessary to set the channel to input, as the analogRead command must
     * assume the 'pin number' it is given refers to a channel on the ADC chip.
     */
}

void loop()
{
    //read the value from the ADC channel
    int value = analogRead( channel );

    //report the value to the output console
    Log( L"Analog value: " );
    Log( value.ToString()->Begin() );
    Log( "\n" );

    //delay for 500ms
    delay( 500 );
}

{% endhighlight %}
