# Installing The Sample Driver

This section demonstrates how to manually copy and install the driver to a Windows IoT Core device:  
 
* We will first use the **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol via a **File Explorer** window to transfer files from the development PC to the target Windwos 10 IoT Core device.  
* We will then use PowerShell to run a few **devcon.exe** commands to install the driver.

<br/>

You can also deploy a driver using Visual Studio during driver development by following the instructions on [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/DriverDeployment)

<br/>

## Transferring Driver Files Using SMB 

* First, boot up your Windows 10 IoT Core device and make a note of its IP Address as displayed on its attached screen when the device first boots up.

* Next, on your development PC, open up a **File Explorer** window, and in the address bar type `\\<TARGET_DEVICE>\C$\` and then hit enter.  In this particular case, `<TARGET_DEVICE>` is the IP Address of your Windows IoT Core device:

    ![SMB with File Explorer]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/DriverLab/smb1.png)

    If you are prompted for a user name and password, and you have not changed the default user name and password, use the following credentials:

        User Name: <TARGET_DEVICE>Administrator
        Password:  p@ssw0rd

    ![SMB with File Explorer]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/DriverLab/cred1.png)

    NOTE: It is **highly recommended** that you update the default password for the Administrator account.  Please follow the instructions found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell)

* Navigate to the `\windows\system32\` folder in the SMB File Explorer window:

    ![SMB with File Explorer]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/DriverLab/smb2.png)

* Drag and drop (copy) the following two files (created in the previous section while building the driver in Visual Studio) from the development machine to the `\windows\system32\` folder on your IoT Core device:

        gpiokmdfdemo.inf
        gpiokmdfdemo.sys

* Drag and drop (copy) the `ACPITABL.dat` file (created in the previous section while building the ACPI table) to the `\windows\system32\` folder.

* Verify that the following files have been successfully transferred to the `\windows\system32\` folder in your IoT Core device using the **File Explorer** window and **SMB**:

        gpiokmdfdemo.inf
        gpiokmdfdemo.sys
        ACPITABL.dat

The next steps involve connecting to the target device using PowerShell as explained [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell).  Make sure you have an active PowerShell connection to your Windows 10 IoT Core device.

<br/>

## Installing the sample driver

* Connect to the target device using the PowerShell `enter-pssession` command as described [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell).

* Using the PowerShell window, navigate to the `C:\Windows\System32` directory on the target device:
    
        [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> cd C:\Windows\System32

* We will use the `devcon.exe` tool to install the sample driver.  Type the following command in the PowerShell window:

        [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\Windows\System32> devcon.exe dp_add gpiokmdfdemo.inf 

<br/>

## Reboot The Windows IoT Core device

From the PowerShell window, type the following command:

    [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> shutdown /r /t 0

The target device will reboot.  After the reboot, make sure PowerShell is still connected to it, otherwise, re-connect to the target device using the PowerShell `enter-pssession` command as described [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/PowerShell).

<br/>

## Check The Status Of The Sample Driver

From the PowerShell window, type the following command:

    [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> devcon status ACPI\GPOT0001

You should see the following output:

    ACPI\GPOT0001\1
        Name: GPIO KMDF Demo Device
        Driver is running.
    1 matching device(s) found.

<br/>

## Toggle The GPIOs

Follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Samples/helloblinky) to connect a resistor and an LED to your Windows IoT Core device.  When you toggle the GPIO connected to the LED, the LED will turn on or off. 

### Use the application provided to communicate with the driver

We have provided a pre-built binary application called BlinkyApp.exe which communicates with the driver to turn on/off the LED.  The application can be found at `DriverSamples\BlinkyApp\BlinkyApp_<PLATFORM>.exe`.

For MinnowBoard Max, `<PLATFORM>` will be `x86`.
For Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, `<PLATFORM>` will be `ARM`.

You will need to copy this file to the target device (Windows IoT Core device) using SMB, or some other means.

In the PowerShell window, navigate to the folder you copied `BlinkyApp_<PLATFORM>.exe` to and type the following command:

    [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> .\BlinkyApp_<PLATFORM>.exe help

You should see a help menu similar to this:

    BlinkyApp: GPIO app tool

    Commands:

      help      : Prints this help message.
      (l)ow  5  : Sets GPIO #5 LOW.
      (h)igh 5  : Sets GPIO #5 HIGH.


    Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 (RPi2 or RPi3) [ARM]: GPIO Pin Mapping and Examples

      GPIO No. |      Example       |      Example       | Header
               |     (GPIO low)     |     (GPIO high)    | Pin No.
      GPIO  4  | BlinkyApp.exe l  4 | BlinkyApp.exe h  4 |    7
      GPIO  5  | BlinkyApp.exe l  5 | BlinkyApp.exe h  5 |   29
      GPIO  6  | BlinkyApp.exe l  6 | BlinkyApp.exe h  6 |   31
      GPIO 12  | BlinkyApp.exe l 12 | BlinkyApp.exe h 12 |   32
      GPIO 13  | BlinkyApp.exe l 13 | BlinkyApp.exe h 13 |   33
      GPIO 16  | BlinkyApp.exe l 16 | BlinkyApp.exe h 16 |   36
      GPIO 18  | BlinkyApp.exe l 18 | BlinkyApp.exe h 18 |   12
      GPIO 22  | BlinkyApp.exe l 22 | BlinkyApp.exe h 22 |   15
      GPIO 23  | BlinkyApp.exe l 23 | BlinkyApp.exe h 23 |   16
      GPIO 24  | BlinkyApp.exe l 24 | BlinkyApp.exe h 24 |   18
      GPIO 25  | BlinkyApp.exe l 25 | BlinkyApp.exe h 25 |   22
      GPIO 26  | BlinkyApp.exe l 26 | BlinkyApp.exe h 26 |   37
      GPIO 27  | BlinkyApp.exe l 27 | BlinkyApp.exe h 27 |   13

If you are using GPIO #5 on the Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, type the following command to turn the LED on:

    [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> .\BlinkyApp_<PLATFORM>.exe low 5

### Note:
Driving the GPIO low will make the LED light-up because of the way the LED is connected as described [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Samples/helloblinky).

To turn the LED off, simply type:

    [192.168.0.243]: PS C:\> .\BlinkyApp_<PLATFORM>.exe high 5

### Use Visual Studio to deploy a driver 
Now that you know how to manually deploy a driver, you can also use Visual to deploy a driver by following the instructions on [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/Docs/DriverDeployment).
