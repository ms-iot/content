# Create A Universal Driver (UD) For Your Windows 10 IoT Core Device



If you are not very familiar with Windows universal drivers yet, we strongly encourage you to start by reading the following materials:

* [Building Universal Drivers - Channel9 Video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/WinHEC/Building-a-Universal-Driver)

* [Getting Started with Universal Windows Drivers - MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn941241(v=vs.85).aspx)

<br/>

## Did you set up your development environment yet?

* Instructions on how to set up your development environment with Visual Studio 2015 can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/GetStarted)

* Additionally, you will need to install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) which you can download from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit) 

<br/>

## Overview
We will now be walking you through the process of creating and installing a simple peripheral device driver that will run on any Windows 10 IoT Core device.  More specifically, we will build a Kernel Mode Device Framework (KMDF) driver using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and the Windows Driver Framework (WDF) APIs.  This driver will be specifically built to be a universal driver.

<br/>

## Description
The name of the driver in this sample is `gpiokmdfdemo`.  This driver will receive different IOCTL commands/messages from a simple user-mode Win32 console application called `BlinkyApp.exe`.  These IOCTL commands will tell the driver what specific GPIO pins to set high or low.  The sample driver (`gpiokmdfdemo`) will in turn communicate with the GpioClx (GPIO Class Extension) in Windows 10 IoT Core to accomplish these requests.  Take a look at the diagram below to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of this driver sample.

## Source Code And Binaries
You can find the source code for this sample by downloading a zip of all of our samples [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/archive/develop.zip) and navigating to the `samples-develop\DriverSamples` where you will find 3 folders:

1. [`DriverSamples\BlinkyApp`](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/DriverSamples/BlinkyApp){:target="_blank"} containing pre-built binaries of the console application for x86 and ARM architectures.gpiokmdfdemo

2. [`DriverSamples\consoleapp\BlinkyApp`](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/DriverSamples/consoleapp/BlinkyApp){:target="_blank"} containing the source code for the console application.

3. [`DriverSamples\gpiokmdfdemo`](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/DriverSamples/gpiokmdfdemo){:target="_blank"} containing the source code for the driver.

<br/>

## Note:
* Some of the instructions in this sample will require running different commands from a command prompt. Please make sure to use an elevated Windows command Prompt (cmd.exe) when running these commands.
* Additionally, some of the instructions will require running command from PowerShell.
