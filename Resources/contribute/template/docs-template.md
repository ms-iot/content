1. You can also use numbering in your document.
2. This is an example of a two lines of numbered list

Below is an image

![This is the alt text for the image]({{site.baseurl}}/Resources/images/Octocat.png)

[This is the text for a link]({{site.baseurl}}/Docs/AllJoyn)

For white images, add a border - be sure to not include the `site.baseurl` when using this:

{% include imageborder.html alt="This is the alt text for the image" link="/Resources/images/MSConnectSignup.png" %}

There are different formatting options for extra emphasis

{% include note.html text="This is a note" %}

{% include warning.html text="This is a warning" %}

{% include tip.html text="This is a tip" %}

{% highlight CS %}
