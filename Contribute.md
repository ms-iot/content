#Iterating on the Galileo SDK
Fork  ms-iot/galileo-sdk as described above in the contribute section.

##Configure Visual Studio
You’ll want to redirect visual studio’s *user templates* to the repository you are working in.
*Tools -> Options*

![Template Config](images/Nuget_TemplateConfig.png)

Under *Projects and Solutions*, select *General*

###For Visual Studio Pro and Ultimate

*Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings*

![Package Config](images/Nuget_PackageSourceConfig_VSU2013.png)

###For Visual Studio Express
*Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings*

![Package Config](images/Nuget_PackageSourceConfig_VSE2013.png)

##Build the Nuget package
Please download the Nuget command line utility [nuget.exe](http://nuget.org/nuget.exe) into the Galileo-SDK root folder.

{% highlight PowerShell %}
build-nupkg.cmd
{% endhighlight %}

##Building the Project
You can now goto *File -> New Project* then Select *Templates -> Visual C++ -> Galileo -> Galileo Wiring app*:

![App Create](images/Nuget_AppCreate.png)

###Build the app
You can now build the application. Please refer to the [Hello Blinky Sample](HelloBlinky.htm) for details on how to build and deploy an application.

###Iterate in the Nuget
Now you need to make changes to the Nuget, you’ll need to uninstall it first. Right click on the Project in the solution and select *Manage Nuget Packages*.

Now Uninstall the Galileo SDK by clicking the uninstall button:

![Nuget Install](images/Nuget_Install.png)

Then select *Online* and *Local Source*

![Nuget Reinstall](images/Nuget_Reinstall.png)

###Install it!
Your updates will be there.


### Notes!
* While you can change your local headers, they will get nuked when reinstalling the nuget package.
* Don’t check in your packages...
* Don’t check in binaries
* You do not need to bump the version when you commit – we’ll bump at release. This requires a change to EVERY project. Nuget doesn’t have wildcards as far as I can tell.

#Best Practices

##Do not check in binaries
Git is not a good binary store. Once a binary is added to the repository, it will be there forever unless extraordinary actions are taken.
Please do not add binaries to Git including:
* The output from a build (debug/release)
* SDF file (code database)
* Nuget package directories

Acceptable binaries:
* PNG, JPG, or other image formats
