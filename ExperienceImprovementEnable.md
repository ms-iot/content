# Helping us, helps you
We constantly endeavor to refine the developer program, and encourage you to opt-in to our Customer Experience Improvement Program by following the steps below so that we can understand how the program can be refined. Turning this on enables us to make a better product that you clearly use - Helping us, helps you.

## At a high level
In order for us to get product insights, you'll need to associate your developer session with the Windows-On-Devices Development Program.  This requires using the GalileoWatcher tool to help with this association, along with enabling Visual Studio feedback.


* GalileoWatcher:  Run this tool to find your connected development board.
* Visual Studio:  Opt-in to Experience Improvement.

# How to enable Customer Experience Improvement ...

### 1) Select your connected board from GalileoWatcher.
  * Make sure your Galileo board is connected to the same subnet as your developer PC, or to the PC directly.
  * Start GalileoWatcher.  It is the locator tool which was installed on your PC from the WindowsDeveloperProgramforIOT.MSI, and used to enumerate connected boards.
  * Select your board name that shows up in GalileoWatcher.  You can optionally right-click to perform one of the listed actions.
  * If your firewall settings were missed, or you do not see your board listed, review the GalileoWatcher information at the [TroubleShooting]({{site.baseurl}}/win8/TroubleShooting.htm) page.
