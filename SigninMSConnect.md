  <h1>Signing into Microsoft Connect</h1>
  <hr/>
  Before downloading any software, you must sign up for the Windows Developer Program for IoT on Microsoft Connect. This is a necessary step in order to download the WindowsDeveloperProgramforIOT.msi and other program files. 
  <br/><br/>
  Microsoft Connect facilitates a unified hosting service for file downloads and provides users with an interface for reporting potential bugs and valuable feedback in our product. The flow of the Microsoft Connect sign-up process can vary based on a number of circumstances.
  <br/><br/>
  Choose the relevant drop-down option below to receive instructions on the process.

Note the radio buttons at the very bottom of the EULA form, and choose either “I Accept” or “I Decline” accordingly.  Then, press “Submit” to submit the EULA.  This will take you to the Completed Registration page, pictured here:
          <br/><img src="images/MSConnectEULAThankYou.png"><br/><br/>

You’re free to download any of them, including a text version of the EULA you just signed to finish registration, but you’re looking to download the MSI.  To do so, click the link circled in red below.
          <br/><img src="images/MSConnectDownload.png"><br/><br/>
